Got you, Rayan. Here's your polished `README.md` content, cleaned up and properly formatted for GitHub. I’ve removed all emojis, restructured the headers for clarity, and made the tone a bit more formal and consistent—while keeping it readable and helpful:

# Spam Email Detection using Naive Bayes Theorem

This project demonstrates a **Spam vs Ham email classifier** built using the **Naive Bayes Theorem**. It includes both **Python (GUI + ML)** and **Excel** implementations, offering a comprehensive understanding of probabilistic text classification.

---

## Project Highlights

- **Naive Bayes Classifier** built with Scikit-learn
- **Spam/Ham Data Visualization** using bar chart, pie chart, and confusion matrix
- **Real-time Classification GUI** developed with Tkinter
- **Excel Implementation** featuring formula-based probability calculations
- **Text Preprocessing** using NLTK (tokenization and stopword removal)
- **Custom CSV File Support** with `Message` and `Category` format

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter

## How to Run the Python Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-naive-bayes.git
   cd spam-email-naive-bayes
````

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python spam_classifier_gui.py
   ```

4. Load your `CSV` file and begin classification.

---

## CSV Format

Your dataset should have two columns with the following structure:

| Message                   | Category |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| You’ve won a free iPhone! | spam     |
| Let’s meet tomorrow.      | ham      |

---

## Visualization Features

* **Bar Chart** showing the count of spam and ham messages
* **Pie Chart** representing percentage distribution
* **Confusion Matrix** to evaluate model performance
* **Text Classification Result** displayed through a popup

---

## Excel-based Implementation

* Manual calculation of:

  * Prior probabilities
  * Word frequencies
  * Conditional probabilities
* Uses Bayes formula directly within Excel formulas
* Ideal for academic presentations and for audiences without coding backgrounds

---

## Use Case

This project is suitable for:

* Learning the fundamentals of **text classification** using Naive Bayes
* Demonstrating a **dual-mode solution** (Python + Excel) in academic settings
* Gaining insight into **basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts

---

## Screenshots

*Include screenshots of the GUI, data visualizations, and Excel sheets here.*
